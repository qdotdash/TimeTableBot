A discord bot made using JavaScript to send timely notifications when a class hour starts. TimeTableBot sends class name and its corresponding google meet link 
to the desired discord channel. It will also send welcome banners to new users. The bot is hosted in Heroku.

Moreover, TimeTable bot supports these basic commands.

## New Features

* Auto join to Google meet links on time : Coupling the Google Meet Enhancement Suite extension and a python script to open links by keywords from a specific channel, now meet joining is automated.

## Basic Commands 

```
timetable help                            //display the commands available in timetable bot
```
